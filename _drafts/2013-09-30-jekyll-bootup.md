Over the time I tried many different various blog software stacks:

* Wordpress
* Drupal
* Tumblr
* own written ROR blog

Each solution is independent and has a good working Ecosystem for coding, updates, plugins and usability.
But Jekyll has one major **plus** benefactor point:  

***It's Static content***

> No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to installâ€”just your content.  
>
> Markdown (or Textile), Liquid, HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment.  
>
> Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.  

This sounds damn __*pretty*__ - and it is ! :]

## Jekyll ... and Hyde ?

If you have ruby in place everything is set for go.  
Use rvm - it makes you happy :)

I used the **[So Simple] [1]** theme by **[Michael Rose] [2]** and when i have more time to design and code a customized theme i will replace it.   

Another good place to find templates to learn/deviate is **[www.jekyllthemes.org] [3]**.  

I will not go in depth on how creating everything - the learn effect is much higher if you go through the **[Jekyll Homepage] [4]** and doing the basics yourself.   

so long
